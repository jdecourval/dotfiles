# -fno-semantic-interposition and -Bsymbolic-functions have similar roles in different scenarios. They prevent function calls inside shared libraries from being indirected. This breaks LD_PRELOAD from overriding intra-so function calls. -Bsymbolic-non-weak-function is a safer version that uses the default behaviour for weak functions. It doesn't seem to be available in GNU ld though.  https://lobste.rs/s/3pgd4h/fno_semantic_interposition#c_2dmfkr
